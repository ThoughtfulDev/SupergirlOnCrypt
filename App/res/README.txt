My name is Kara Zor-El. I'm from Krypton.
I'm a refugee on this planet. I was sent to Earth to protect my cousin.
But my pod got knocked off-course, and by the time I got here, my cousin had already grown up and become... Superman.
I hid who I really was until one day when an accident forced me to reveal myself to the world.
To most people, I'm a reporter at CatCo Worldwide Media.
But in secret, I work with my adoptive sister for the D.E.O. to protect my city from alien life and anyone else that means to cause it harm.

I am Supergirl ... and i encrypted your Files :D
